# Autism Facial Emotion Detection

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for detecting facial emotions in individuals with autism using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes machine learning models to analyze facial expressions and classify emotions.

## Features
- Facial emotion detection using deep learning.
- Preprocessing of facial images.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Deployment-ready Google Colab notebook.

## Installation & Requirements
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```python
   !pip install kaggle
   !pip install deepface opencv-python kagglehub matplotlib
   ```
3. Ensure required datasets are available.

## Usage
1. Upload the dataset to Google Colab or connect to Google Drive.
2. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and test its performance.
3. Analyze the results and predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset should include labeled facial images representing different emotions. Ensure it is properly structured for training the model.

## Model
- Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for emotion classification.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.

## Results
The model achieves reliable accuracy in detecting emotions from facial expressions, aiding in autism research and support.
